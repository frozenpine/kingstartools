# Description
# -----------  
#	This example program demonstrates sending a RPC command
#	to a Server and the processing of row, parameter, and status
#	results returned from the remote procedure. It also demonstrates  
#	the use of different datatypes as parameters.
#       
#      
# Inputs
# ------         
# 	None.
#      
# Server Tables
# -------------  
#       None.
