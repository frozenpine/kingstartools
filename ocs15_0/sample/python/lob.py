# Description
# -----------  
#    	This example demonstrates transferring lob data for text and
#	image columns. Data is first transferred from a bytearray object.
#	Next data is transferred from a file. Finally data is 
#	is retrieved from the lob columns and displayed.
#	Names of two files are required to run the sample. The files will
#	will be used as data for text and image columns.
#      
# Inputs
# ------         
#    	None.
#      
# Server Tables
# -------------  
#	None.
