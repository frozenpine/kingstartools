** Description
** -----------
**	This example is meant to be run from a command line.
**	When called with the '-i' command line parameter:
**	The user is queried for a server name, user name and password.
**	A sample DSN string is generated, the user may change it.
**	A connection, using the DSN string is opened to the server.
**	The server name we're connected to, the login used and the current
**	database are retrieved and displayed.
**	The connection is closed again.
**	When called without the '-i' (or a different) command line parameter:
**	A valid DSN string is generated with the default server name,
**	user name and password as defined in sample_utils.php, a connection
**	to the server is opened, if successful a message confirming this is
**	displayed and the connection is closed again.
**
** Requirements
** ------------
**	An ASE with a valid user account on it.
