This is the README file for PHP sample scripts.

The sample scripts demonstrate specific functionality of the Sybase
PHP extension. These scripts are designed as guides for application programmers,
not as PHP training aids.

It is recommended that users read the descriptions at the top of each
script file and examine the source code prior to attempting to use the
sample script. 

Lastly, these script are not intended as examples of robust,
production-quality open client applications; only minimal effort has
been made to "bullet-proof" these examples.

LIST OF EXAMPLE PROGRAMS (Source file names given in parentheses)

firstapp	(FILES: firstapp.php)

        A simple example program that connects to a server, sends a
        select query, and prints the rows. 

dsnconnect	(FILES: dsnconnect.php, sample_utils.php)

	A simple example program that connects to a server using a DSN
	connection string. It prints out the servername, account and
	the current database.

rpc		(FILES: rpc.php, sample_utils.php)

	An example program that demonstrates how to call an RPC command
	with input parameters and how to process print statements
	and output parameter results returned from the RPC command.

RUNNING THE EXAMPLES

To run an example, perform the following steps:

 1.	Verify that you have a user account on an available ASE. 
	These samples will work with OCS 15.7 and up. 
	Depending on the example program, there may be special requirements.
	For each example, the introductory comment in the main source file 
	lists the specific server requirements. 

 2.	Set the following environment variables:

	${SYBASE} is set to the full pathname of the Sybase root directory.

	${SYBASE_OCS} is set to the directory where the Open Client
		product is installed (e.g. OCS-15_0).

	${DSQUERY} is set to the name of the server to connect to.

	Set the library path environment variable. Depending on your platform, 
	use the following (example for Sun Solaris):

        	C-shell:
		setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH ${SYBASE}/${SYBASE_OCS}/lib

		Bourne/Korn shell:
		LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${SYBASE}/${SYBASE_OCS}/lib
		export LD_LIBRARY_PATH

	Note 1: Refer to your operating sytem documentation for the
		name of the library path environment variable.
		(E.g. on hpux, use SHLIB_PATH)

	Note 2: Some platforms (sun_svr4, hpux) require /usr/ccs/bin
		in your path.

	Note 3: Some platforms (such as rs6000) require /usr/lib in
		your LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

 4.	Add a line to your default php.ini file that loads the
 	Sybase PHP extension. You can find an example in
	$SYBASE/$SYBASE_OCS/config/php.ini
	Alternatively you can set the path to this php.ini file in the
	PHPRC environment variable or call php with the -c command line option.

 5.	Run the example with the command:
 	php <program>
	or
	php -c <path to php.ini> <program>
	where <program> is the file name of the program
