# Note 
# ----
#	no path to perl, use perl ./firstapp.pl (Unix/Linux)
# 	or perl .\firstapp.pl (Windows) or alternatively, add a path
# 	on the first line to accomodate for your specific platform:
#
# 	Unix/linux example: #!/usr/local/bin/perl
# 	Windows example:    #!perl
#
# Description
# -----------
#    	This is the Perl equivalent example program that is printed in 
#    	Chapter 1 of the Client-Library Programmer's Guide. It connects 
#    	to a server, sends a select query, prints the rows, disconnects, 
#    	and exits.
#
#    	Make sure the correct version of the Perl interpreter is in your
#    	path.
#
# Input
# ------
#    	None.
#
# Database 
# --------
#    	This program requires the pubs2 database.
#
# Requirements
# ------------
#    	ASE 15.7 and OCS 15.7 client installation
#    	Linux/Unix: Perl 5.14.0 or 5.14.1 installation.
#    	Windows: ActiveState Perl version:
#		ActivePerl-5.14.1.1401-MSWin32-x64-294969 or later.
#
#    	DBI installed, version 1.616
#    	Set PERL5LIB to $SYBASE/$SYBASE_OCS/perl/<mode>/<r>
#    	where <mode> is sybaseperl_32 or sybaseperl_64
#    	and <r> is either "r" for re-entrant or omitted.
#
#    	Example for linux on Intel, 64bit, re-entrant using
#    	non-debug libraries: 
#
#    	$SYBASE/$SYBASE_OCS/perl/sybaseperl_64r/lib/lib
#    	$SYBASE/$SYBASE_OCS/perl/sybaseperl_64r/lib/arch
#
#    	Example for Windows on Intel, 64bit, non-debug libraries: 
#
#    	$SYBASE/$SYBASE_OCS/perl/sybaseperl_64/dll/lib
#    	$SYBASE/$SYBASE_OCS/perl/sybaseperl_64/dll/arch
