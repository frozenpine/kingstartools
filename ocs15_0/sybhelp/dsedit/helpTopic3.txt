EDITING A SERVER ENTRY
  
Use the Server Entry Editor to add or modify interfaces file 
entries for servers in your Sybase installation. 
You can also use this screen to view the following information 
about a server:
  
Server Name
-----------
If you are adding a server entry, type the server name in this field.

If you are modifying a server entry, this field displays the name of the 
server you selected in the Directory Service Session screen. 
  
If you change this value to a server name that is not used in 
this interfaces file, dsedit creates a new entry as a copy of the old 
entry and deletes the old entry.

Security Mechanism
------------------
The name of the third-party network security mechanism (such as DCE, 
Banyan, or CyberSafe) that this server will use, as listed in the

If you are using more than one security mechanism, enter the names, 
separated by commas.
