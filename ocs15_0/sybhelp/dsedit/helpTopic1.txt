SPECIFYING AN INTERFACES FILE TO EDIT

You can store server/client network connection information in
the Sybase interfaces file. The interfaces file contains server 
location and connection information. 
 
When you install Sybase products, the default file $SYBASE/interfaces 
is created.

To add, modify, or delete server information in an interfaces file:
  
1. Click Sybase Interfaces File at the top of the screen.

2. Verify that the default interfaces file whose name appears in 
   the Interfaces File to Edit field is the file you want to edit.

   If this is not the file you want, type the name of a different 
   interfaces file in this field.

3. Click OK.

If the file you have specified does not exist, dsedit creates an 
empty file.

For more information about interfaces files, see the Adaptive Server 
installation guide.
